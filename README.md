## Cute 

**Cute** is a cute little programming language that I am working on.

### Purpose

I'm designing `cute` to be as cute as possible. What I mean is that the user can program as easily as possible while having fun. To program without thinking much about the syntax or the language rules. To program with ton of fun features. To offer modularity, ease of use and performance without making programming seem like a chore.

### Building

Though nothing works right now, you can install v0.0.1.

Building `cute` is easy, you can just:
```bash
cmake -B build
cd build
make
```
