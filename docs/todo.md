## Todo

Because I keep forgetting what i need to do:

+ Add typecasting explicit. (done)

+ Refactor code and implement proper basic arithmetic (done)

+ Implement an IR (dont)

+ Add loop: while

+ Add conditionals: if, else

+ Add functions

+ Add recursion

+ Refactor how the binary operations are handled throughout the compiler.

+ Fix incorrect parsing behavior. [] brackets are not parsed properly. Expressions don't end nicely and () don't work properly for them when not closed.

+ Improve the node printer. 

+ Change the way how node walker does dispatch, I'm thinking of using a pure visitor pattern for ease of development.

+ Added implicit type casting and basic type inference
